From the National Kidney Foundation website:

What are immunosuppressants?
Immunosuppressants are drugs or medicines that lower the body's ability to reject a transplanted organ.
Another term for these drugs is anti-rejection drugs. There are 2 types of immunosuppressants:
    Induction drugs: Powerful antirejection medicine used at the time of transplant
    Maintenance drugs: Antirejection medications used for the long term.
(...)
There are usually 4 classes of maintenance drugs:
    Calcineurin Inhibitors: Tacrolimus and Cyclosporine (a.k.a. CsA)
    Antiproliferative agents: Mycophenolate Mofetil, Mycophenolate Sodium and Azathioprine
    mTOR inhibitor: Sirolimus (a.k.a. Rapamycin)
    Steroids: Prednisone

Purine metabolism and immunosuppressive effects of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
A C Allison, E M Eugui
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a novel immunosuppressive drug that shows promise in preventing the rejection of organ allografts and in the treatment of ongoing rejection.
Orally administered MMF is hydrolyzed by esterases in the intestine and blood to release mycophenolic acid (MPA), a potent, selective, noncompetitive inhibitor of the type 2 isoform of inosine monophosphate dehydroxygenase (IMPDH) expressed in activated human T and B lymphocytes.
By inhibiting IMPDH, MPA depletes the pool of dGTP required for DNA synthesis.
MPA has a more potent cytostatic effect on lymphocytes than on other cell types, and this is the principal mechanism by which immunosuppressive activity is exerted.
MPA also depletes pools of GTP in human lymphocytes and monocytes,
thereby inhibiting the synthesis of fucose- and mannose-containing saccharide components
of membrane glycoproteins.
